### What is Naive Bayes Model

Naive Bayes Model is an old method for classification and predictor selection that is enjoying a renaissance because of its simplicity and stability.

Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.It is widely use for text classification which used in various applications google search, email sorting, language detection.

Below is the formula for calculating the conditional probability.

P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H)/P(E)

where

P(H) is the probability of hypothesis H being true. This is known as the prior probability.
P(E) is the probability of the evidence(regardless of the hypothesis).
P(E|H) is the probability of the evidence given that hypothesis is true.
P(H|E) is the probability of the hypothesis given that the evidence is there.
